Firstly, you can use 127.0.0.1, which, called the loopback address, does not even expose your server to the local network. This is good for testing, as it is the same for every device (including whatever machine is remotely running this colab notebook), and cannot be accessed from another machine by mistake, and it is what we will use exclusively for this tutorial. Another option, when running servers locally, would be to use your device's local IP, assigned by your router. This usually begins with 192.168. It can be found on windows by running the command \"ipconfig\" in command prompt. Finally, you can expose your server to the web by using your device's global IP address.\n",

Ultimately, we are interested in showing you how we script multiple servers together in HELAO, and that requires talking about some more advanced concepts that are central to writing web servers. Asynchronous programming can be tricky to get the hang of, and a full introduction is beyond the scope of this workshop, but we hope to familiarize you with the basics here.\n",

The rules are that every function defined with the async keyword must be called with the await keyword, and every function that contains an await keyword must be defined with the async keyword.\n",

It is hard to explain, but basically, when your code hits an \"await\" statement, it reads that as, \"I can go do other things while waiting for this to complete.\" What \"other things\" means in this context is complicated -- the code isn't going to skip that line, for example -- but in the context of our servers, it means that the server is free to process other requests while one request is running.\n",

The goal here is to rewrite the server so that is able to respond while the \"motor\" is moving.
